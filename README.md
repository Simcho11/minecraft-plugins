# minecraft-plugins
This is a repository of the Minecraft plugins I have created during my free time. These were made from 2021-present and were all made in Java using the Spigot API.

## UHC
This plugin is based on the popular Minecraft minigame "Ultra Hard Core" in which players spawn in a Minecraft world and have to make tools and weapons to take out the other players.

**Successes**
- Plugin is very lightweight
- Successfully teleports players in teams around a world
- Creates a world border that closes after a set period of time
- Was able to have a YouTuber successfully host a UHC event with said plugin

**Room for Improvement**
- Plugin isn't very general - not made to be distributed to consumers
- Sometimes leans on Minecraft's built in commands rather than using the Spigot API

**Takeaways**
- This was my first Java project so I came out with much more Java knowledge than before
- First time working with an API so I gained experience working with and API
